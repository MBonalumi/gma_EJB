# Gamified Marketing App - a JPA Application
The goal of the project was to implement a fully functional webapp using the Java Persistency API as an interface between the web client and the database.

The webapp consisted of a page for an admin to create marketing questionnaires about products and upload new products, while also visualize the results. 
Pages for clients to compile the questionnaires, in a gamified manner, with a results page to check a leaderboard.
Two login pages to manage access for users and admins.
A functionality of filtering swearwords out of compiled questionnaire at submission.

The project comprehends a fullstack implementation, using ThymeLeaf for the frontend.
